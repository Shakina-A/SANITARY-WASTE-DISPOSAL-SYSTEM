Our project focuses on designing and implementing an automated sanitary waste incinerator system. Sanitary waste management is a critical aspect of maintaining public health and environmental sustainability. This project introduces an innovative approach to sanitary waste management through the development of an automated incinerator system. Utilizing an IR sensor for waste detection, an Arduino microcontroller for signal processing, and a relaytransistor mechanism for power control, the system activates a heating coil upon waste detection. A built-in time-delay ensures safe operation by automatically shutting down the incineration process after a set period. Effective waste management systems are essential for preventing the spread of diseases, protecting water sources, and preserving ecological balance. By addressing these critical concerns, our automated incinerator system offers a practical solution for sanitary waste disposal, contributing to healthier communities and a cleaner environment.
